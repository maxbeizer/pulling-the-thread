    Pulling the Thread is a blog dedicated to those who work (or want to work)
    in tech but who don't fit the stereotype. If you think you aren't the typical
    programmer, if you think that you'll never fit in with the typical programmers,
    or if you don't know how to get started, this blog is for you.
